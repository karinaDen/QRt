# QRt: QR Code Art Generator  

## Project description  

In today's digital age, QR-codes have become an essential part of our daily lives, serving as gateways to a world of information. The concept of transforming these black-and-white squares into beautiful masterpieces is gaining popularity. However, a challenge persists that needs to be addressed; current QR code generators often do not deliver stable and reliable results.  

To tackle this challenge, we used advanced generative models, which are Stable Diffusion and Control Nets. By using these models, QRt aims to deliver a stable and user-friendly platform that seamlessly merges beauty with functionality, unlocking the full potential of QR codes as both art and information.
